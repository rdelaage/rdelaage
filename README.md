ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rdelaage

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in System and Network Engineering, Free Software, Distributed Systems. I'm curious about everything

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying at the University of Technology of CompiÃ¨gne. I mainly contribute to picasoft.net, but also to small software that I use regularly such as Miniflux, Castopod, Autorestic or ergol-http.

ðŸ“« How to reach me on the Fediverse (@rdelaage@mamot.fr) or on Matrix (@rdelaage:matrix.org). My work is mainly hosted on git.rdelaage.ovh
